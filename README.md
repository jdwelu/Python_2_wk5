In this assignment we were tasked with parsing an XML document. The file being parsed is the cd_catalog.xml file. Out of the given XML tags,
we were tasked with getting the ARTIST, TITLE, and decade, and then displaying it on the screen. While this was a simple program, it serves 
as a good example on how to use Python to parse an XML file.
